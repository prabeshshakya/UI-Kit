                A Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets (Sass) Starter Kit is a
                collection of resources, templates, and tools designed to help
                developers get started with using Sass to enhance their CSS
                workflow. This type of starter kit provides a foundation for
                creating and managing styles using the Sass preprocessor, which
                offers various features and benefits compared to writing raw
                CSS. Here's what you might find in a Sass Starter Kit:

                A Sass Starter Kit is meant to provide developers, especially
                those who are new to Sass, with a jump-start into using the
                preprocessor effectively. It can help streamline the learning
                curve and provide best practices for structuring and maintaining
                styles in a scalable and maintainable manner. As you become more
                comfortable with Sass, you can customize and expand upon the
                starter kit to suit your specific project requirements and
                preferences.

                Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets (Sass) is a scripting language
                that serves as a powerful extension of CSS (Cascading Style
                Sheets). It introduces various enhancements and features to make
                working with stylesheets more efficient and maintainable. Sass
                is used to generate standard CSS that web browsers can
                understand, but it provides a more flexible and expressive way
                to write and organize your styles. You can find the detailed
                documentation of SASS in the given link

              </p>
              <p>
                SCSS is also backward compatible. It can be used to write older
                version CSS as well.

              <p>
                We do this by dividing up our stylesheets into separate files
                using Partials. The separate files will represent different
                components. We then import our partials using an @import
                directive, into one master stylesheet â€” typically the style.scss
                file. For example:
              </p>
              <Syntax language="scss">{styleScss}</Syntax>
              <p>
                We could then create a layout folder for our layout specific
                files, such as:
              </p>
              <Syntax language="scss">{specificScss}</Syntax>
              <p>
                <i>Note:</i> The name of a partial file always begins with an
                underscore <code>_</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you might have noticed, in every folder, there is a file,
                called <code>__index.scss</code>. It is there because you no
                longer need to import each file from the folder one by one. In
                <code>__index.scss</code> file.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, in our case, in <code>scss/</code>
                <code>utilities/</code>
                <code>classes/</code> folder, there are different files except
                for <code>__index.scss</code> one. In <code>__index.scss</code>{" "}
                file, we can "@import" each file within that folder:
              </p>
              <Syntax language="scss">{indexScss}</Syntax>
